Random Squares Generator
This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript’s createElement method and Math.random to generate multiple squares at random positions and random rotations on the page. Click the button to add fun, colorful squares wherever you want!

How it Works

- When you click the “Add Square” button, a new square appears in a random location on the screen.

- Each square is rotated at a random angle for visual variety.

- The code combines createElement, simple CSS for styling, and Math.random for generating positions and rotations.
